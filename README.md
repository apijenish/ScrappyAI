## About Cycle Craft Georgia
Cycle Craft Georgia is the premier, locally-owned bicycle retailer with multiple locations across Georgia, including flagship stores in Atlanta, Savannah, and Athens. We offer:

### Our Story 
Founded in 2008 by **Sarah Chen**, a former competitive cyclist, Cycle Craft Georgia started as a small brick-and-mortar shop in Roswell. The mission was simple: provide Georgians with the best-quality bikes and the knowledge to make cycling a core part of their lives.

Today, Cycle Craft Georgia operates multiple locations, each acting as a local gathering place for cyclists from historic Savannah to bustling Atlanta and the rolling hills of Athens.

## Business Challenge

### The Problem
Cycle Craft Georgia operates multiple stores, each with unique market dynamics. Regional managers need timely sales data to make strategic decisions, but they:

- Are not data analysts
- Lack technical skills to query databases directly
- Must submit requests to a small IT department
- Experience delays of several days for data analysis
- Miss opportunities due to slow, reactive data access

### Solution: Scrappy Market Agentic AI System
An intelligent system that translates natural-language business questions into SQL queries, automating the manual inspection of database tables and putting data insights directly into the hands of decision-makers.

### Use Case Scenario
A regional manager overseeing multiple stores needs to plan inventory and marketing for the ipdcoming quarter. Instead of emailing IT, the regional manager can log into the Scrappy Market system and ask: 
- **"Show me the total sales revenue for e-bikes at the Atlanta, Athens, and Savannah stores over the last 90 days."**
